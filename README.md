# AbcuBinarySearchTree
A binary search tree structure (application) to search, and print a curriculum.

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The client (ABC University) requested an application that sorts, prints, and searches for a course program's curriculum, prereqs, and information. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I began by documenting psuedo-code for three different data structures that could be used for this application. Once completed I analyzed the runtime and memory usage of the structures using "Big-O" notation, and charted them out. I than developed the C++ application based on the psuedo-code of the structure I thought would work most efficiently for the task. This was important because you don't want to produce an application that uses unnesssecary amounts of memory storage or time.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  When hitting a roadblock I would read different examples of the data structure and break them down into smaller parts. Once I had a basic understanding of each element in the structure I would alter it to fit the application I was developing.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  This project, most importantly, gave me an excellent understanding of how to begin approaching the development of an application can use various data structures and algorithms.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The entirety of the application is modular, and secure. I learned how to keep certain elements of the program secure but in a way that is still accessable to other portions of the program. This also reinforced how to develop code by following the previously planned flow-chart since every function and structure was made modularly, and well commented to improve readability.
